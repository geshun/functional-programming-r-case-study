# Functional Programming for Data Science with R
## A real world example to facilitate data pre-processing with Tidyverse

Perhaps you are aware that one of the fascinating stories told through data can be found on the Gap-minder website, where we observe the evolution of the relationship between a country's life expectancy, gross domestic product per capita, and its population.

Let's go on a journey to explore how to prepare data for analysis using `R` statistical programming language. We'll use datasets from the gapminder website and learn functional techniques for preparing them for analysis. I love how R handles data and I hope you'll enjoy it too.
